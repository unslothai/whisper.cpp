# The bundles produced here are downloaded and executed on user machines by the
# Unsloth Studio installer, which fetches them after its own signed installer has
# already run. Nothing else signs them, so an unsigned file here reaches the user
# unsigned. Windows Smart App Control evaluates every binary as it loads and
# blocks unknown unsigned code, reporting it as a "Bad Image" dialog with status
# 0xc0e90002 naming whichever dependent DLL it refused, so signing only the
# launcher executables is not enough: every DLL in the tree has to be signed.
#
# Signing is batched. trusted-signing-cli takes any number of trailing paths and
# authenticates to Azure once per invocation, so a bundle of ~50 files costs one
# round trip instead of fifty.
